# java-OpsourceSimpleApp

This is a mock application developed for an interview hiring process. It is a CRUD application written in Java that accesses to MySQL database and XML to persist the data. It is carefully designed using patterns and good practices in programming. The idea behind the exercise is to solve it with a well-designed and high quality approach.

I have parsed the readme.txt to a png image in order to avoid search engines to index it, as I have seen it is a pretty common exercise.
